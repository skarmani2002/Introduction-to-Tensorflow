Predicting The House Price Using Tensor flow
Tensor flow for Artificial intelligence
For we are going to build a neural network that predicts the price of a house according to a simple formula.So, imagine if house pricing was as easy as a house costs 50k + 50k per bedroom, so that a 1 bedroom house costs 100k, a 2 bedroom house costs 150k etc.
